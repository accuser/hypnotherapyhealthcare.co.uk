RTT is a type of hypnotherapy that allows you to get to the root cause of an issue rapidly, often only one session is needed. Hypnotherapy allows you to access your subconscious (your emotional) mind, where often before the age of 7 we have formed beliefs about ourselves and the world due to events that have occurred when we were only young. We may not be aware of these subconscious beliefs as an adult, but know that something is holding us back/limiting us. These limiting beliefs are identified during hypnosis, and allows you to understand how and why these beliefs occurred and allows you to make sense of them and free you from them. It allows you to change these limiting beliefs quickly to ones that are helpful, relevant and purposeful for you. You are in complete control during hypnotherapy - it is a beautiful relaxed state, sometimes called a sleep of the nervous system. You are not asleep though and are fully aware of what is happening and you will only do what you want to do and will allow you to reframe your beliefs to what you know is true deep within yourself. It allows you to let go of anything you want to let go, and as your accessing your subconscious mind this occurs much quicker than if you were to try and do this out of hypnosis.You survive on this planet by avoiding emotional and physical pain. Your mind does what it thinks you want it to do and what it believes is in your best interests, based on your thoughts, feelings and beliefs, which it has registered from your thinking, responses and interpretation of your life events. The brain is hardwired to pay more attention to negative experiences than positive ones, to be alert to danger and pain, in order to ensure survival. The subconscious mind is responsible for over 90% of our actions - it is also the habitual mind. It is accessed through the theta brainwave state, and is the brainwave state of children under 7, when core hardwired beliefs are coded, and our map of the world is created. It is the automatic processing hub and filing system/stores and retrieves data, which can be accessed and adjusted via hypnosis. It stores and automatically repeats learned experiences, skills, habits, programmes and beliefs. The conscious mind is responsible for 10% of our actions. It analyses, think and plans, desires. It is the beta brainwave state.

The subconscious mind generates your emotions and feelings, your conscious (thinking) mind provides you with logical reasoning. Emotion will always over-ride logic, and it is therefore difficult to change limiting beliefs by using logic and your conscious mind. When going into hypnosis you go into REM-rapid eye movement -which is what occurs during sleep. This accesses delta followed by theta brain waves which accesses our subconscious / limbic /habitual/emotional brain. Emotion will always override logic, which is why it is difficult to stop doing something, even if you want to, as your emotional brain overrides. Hypnotherapy and in particular RTT alters our state of consciousness, switching our conscious mind off temporarily and allowing the subconscious/emotional brain to become more alert. By accessing the subconscious mind you can access your processing and filing system, understanding what has caused particular held beliefs/emotional responses, and therefore transform unhelpful ones/ anything that is holding you back from fulfilling your true potential. Essentially you are reprogramming what you want to reprogramme, changing any unhelpful beliefs or habits.

Neuroplasticity is a relatively recent discovery of how flexible our brain circuits are. Neurons that fire together, wire together. When a circuit fires repeatedly, it can become the default setting, automating the response. RTT enables you to turn off unhelpful wiring, and form helpful connections in your brain. Psychiatrist Dr Bessel Van Der Kolk in his book on transforming the mind, brain and body after trauma “ The body keeps the score” states our challenge is to apply lessons of neuroplasticity, the flexibility of brain circuits, to rewire our brains and reorganise our minds, so that unhelpful, harmful programmes that have been coded secondary to life’s traumas are rewired to helpful, nourishing, positive programmes. RTT is a definite and rapid way of doing just this.

As part of the hypnotherapy session you will receive a transformation recording which is bespoke and personal to you. The brain learns by repetition, ( you want to ‘fire repeatedly and subsequently wire’ neurons in positive brain circuits) and by listening to this recording you will embed the therapeutic positive change within you. I recommend listening to it for at least 21 days. You will want to listen to it, as it will be speaking directly to you and your subconscious.

The amazing truth about neuroplasticity is we can, YOU can CHOOSE to think and believe differently. I CHOOSE TO BE… irrespective our past life events, you can choose to reprogramme unhelpful beliefs that you coded when you were younger, as you are older now and through RTT you can rapidly change any unhelpful brain wiring to helpful ones.

Marisa Peer, famous hypnotherapist who developed RTT has written about the rules of the mind, which are extremely useful to know and understand.

We cannot battle with our minds, as emotion overrides logic, and you can’t fight against your wiring. However when you understand how and why your mind operates the way it does, then you can start to work with it rather than against it.

# Rules of the mind

1. Your every thought and word forms a blueprint that your mind and body work to make a reality
2. You act in a way that consistently matches your thinking
3. Every thought you think causes a physical reaction and an emotional response. ( Chemicals/ hormones are released). You cannot separate mind and body. ‘The Body Keeps the Score’, and many physical illnesses arise from previous traumas, stress/negative repetitive habitual thought patterns.
4. Imagination is more powerful than knowledge when dealign with your own mind, and the mind of others
5. In a battle between emotion and logic, emotion will always win.
6. Your mind always does what it thinks you want it to, ie what you say to yourself
7. Your mind works to move you from pain to pleasure
8.  Your mind is hardwired to resist what is unfamiliar and to return to what is familiar. So make what is negative and familiar, unfamiliar, and make way is positive and unfamiliar, familiar. Create and form new positive habits/beliefs. Importance of listening to the transformation recording for at least 21 days.
9. Your mind responds to the pictures you create in your head, and the words you tell yourself. You can change these, but your habitual words and thoughts become your reality. Make sure they are good.
10. Your mind does not care if what you tell it is good, bad, true, false, healthy unhealthy, right or wrong. It accepts and acts on your words regardless.
11. You make your beliefs, then your beliefs make you and your reality.
12. What your present to your mind, your mind will present back to you
13. The mind cannot hold conflicting beliefs or thoughts, they cancel each other out.
14. Your subconscious mind only works in the present tense.
15. Your mind can only respond to words that make pictures, the more vivid the picture, the powerful the response.
16. Your mind responds better to positive, specific detailed dynamic words and instructions.
17. Your mind learns by repetition. (Neuroplasticity, fire and wire)
18. What is expected tends to be realised
19. What ever you focus on, you get more of
20. When dealing with the subconscious mind, the greater the conscious effort, the less the subconscious responds

# My story

I am a GP and feel privileged to be in a position where I can help people to understand and identify why they are unwell and provide them with treatment options for them to choose from. Conventional medicine is very useful for many areas of ill health, but there are many areas where conventional medicine doesn’t have the answers. There are many illnesses that occur due to stress and how we think and what we believe about ourselves. I started to become frustrated by the limitations of conventional medicine, knowing that a pill wasn’t going to fix the problem in the long term. Psychotherapies available on the NHS are limited and take time to work, often not getting to the root cause of the problem, and I became acutely aware of patients not improving and becoming frustrated with not being provided with the resources to understand and be free from their illnesses. I also had a drive to want to create wellbeing and prevent ill health. RTT is an amazing way of doing this and can be helpful in treating the following : Anxiety, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Phobias, Addictions,Tics, Eating Disorders, Weight problems, Chronic Pain Syndromes, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Insomnia, Migraine, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Unexplained Infertility, Auto-immune disorders, Skin conditions, Tinnitis, Lack of Confidence, Low Self-esteem, Public Speaking, Interview skills, Exams. This list is not exhaustive and if in any doubt whether this form of therapy will be useful to yourself please do contact me.

Personally I have suffered with anxiety, self doubt and postnatal depression, and know what an impact this had on myself and my family. In my case I now realise both of these occurred due to my thoughts and limiting beliefs, many of which I had developed at a young age, surfacing later in life. Through hypnosis I have come to understand that my previous lack of self belief started when I was a newborn. As a baby I had interpreted the disappointment of my parents of me not being a boy, into the belief that I was not good enough. Through hypnotherapy I have now changed this wrongly held belief, and have incredible increasing self belief. Medication did help with the postnatal depression, but the anxiety lingered, and it is only through yoga, meditation and hypnotherapy that I have had a breakthrough with this. 

The hypnotherapy has enabled me to understand the root cause of the anxiety and to reframe it, freeing me from this.

I had the opportunity to meet a GP who had already trained in hypnotherapy and was amazed at the benefits of having hypnosis. After one session I felt full of energy but also tranquility and positivity. I had to find out more. This GP told me his story of having Bells palsy, which is where the facial muscles are affected on one side of the face, causing disfigurement and difficulty speaking. In his case this didn’t resolve with time or conventional medicine, but resolved during hypnosis and has remained so since his hypnotherapy.

Hypnotherapy allows you to identify the root cause and reason for your issues, allowing you to understand and then free yourself from any self limiting belief. As a RTT therapist I am there to facilitate you in this, but you are the one on control and are being empowered to treat yourself. 

It is an effective treatment for many conditions as described above and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) have recognised it as a treatment option for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. 

RTT is a single 60- to 90-minute session. It is useful to have a 20-minute discussion prior to the session to understand what you want to work on. The RTT session can be face-to-face, but it also works effectively virtually, and I find Zoom an effective way of doing this.
